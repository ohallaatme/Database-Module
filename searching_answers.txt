Q: Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: Three

5.

Q:Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Linear, because binary searches only work on sorted collections

6.

Q: Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A:  Binary, because it sorts through sorted collections to divide and conquer.

Q: You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A: var miniDictionary = ["Aardvark", "Albatross", "Jubilant", "Onerous", "Serendipity"]

var findingAlbatross = function(collection, value) {
    let low = collection[0]
    let high = collection[collection.length -1];
    
    while(low <= high){
    	let mid = (collection.indexOf(low) + collection.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    	mid = Math.round(mid);
        if(collection[mid] > value) {
            high = collection[mid - 1]
            } else if(collection[mid] < value) {
                low = collection[mid + 1]
                } else {
                    return collection[mid];  
                }
			
    }
return "That name is not on list"

Q: You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

A: var mySchool= ["one fish", "Two Fish", "Red fish", "Blue Fish", "Gold Fish"]

function findFish(collection, target){
    var result = null, value;
    for(var i = 0; i < collection.length; i++) {
        value = collection[i];
        if(value == target){
            result = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    return result;
};
