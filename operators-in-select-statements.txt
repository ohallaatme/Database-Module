Q: List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

A: 

> - I would use this to filter my selection to an age that is greater than a number

< - I would use this to filter my selection to a date that is before the date I list to filter a selection

= - I would use this to select data equal to a value, for example if someones age equals 18

>= - I would use this to filter a selection on a column for something greater than or equal to a value, like an age or date

!= - I would use this to filter out values that are not equal to a value, for example to select individuals whose names are not Dan.

<> - I would use this to filter out values that are not equal to a value, for example to select individuals whose names are not Dan.

LIKE - I would use this to find a title of something if I can only remember part of the string. For example movies LIKE '%Star Wars%'.

BETWEEN - I would use this to filter to a range of values, for example weight BETWEEN 110 and 150 lbs.

IS TRUE/ IS FALSE - I would use this to filter data on a boolean value, for example if this was testing data for a candidate, where passed IS TRUE.

IS NULL - I would use this to filter on blank values, for example felony charges IS NULL

AND - I would use this to add another condition where two things have to be true, for example has graduated high school AND age is > 21.

OR - I would use this to select records where one or another condition could be true, for example dog is brown or dog weight is > 30

NOT - I would use this to exclude records from a filter, for example dog breed is not like chihuahua.
