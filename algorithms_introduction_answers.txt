Q: Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful (e.g. Google's search algorithm).

A:

1. Uber's platform algorithm of dynamic pricing that seeks equilibrium among a host of variables.

2. Facebook's algorithm that prioritizes meaningful interactions from friends and family


3. Instagrams algorithm to provide content that captures the users attention as an advertising platform

Q: Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm vs an inefficient one.

A: I would think that an efficient algorithm:
	- utilizes least amount of memory/resources needed
	- is fast

 Whereas an inefficient one takes up too much memory/resources and is much slower.
